# Discord-Bot
My first project on Discord bot using node.js v14. In this project, I'll tell you how to make a Discord Bot, using Node.js for the Beginner.

> [!NOTE]
> Some code **may** not work properly in future as the update comes. So please make sure to check codes and updates from official sites. Also, keep in mind that I'm using Visual Studio Code for this project. If you want to use external application such as [replit.com](https://replit.com/), etc. you can ignore some of these steps from here. But I suggest you to start your project in `Visual Studio Code` only.

# Steps to setup your Visual Studio Code.
Here are the steps to setup your `Visual Studio` Code for bot making.
- Download/Update your [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
- Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).
- Install your Node.js after downloading it.
- Create a folder in your files and name it anything you like.
- Then open your folder using `Visual Studio Code`
> [!TIP]
> You can open your folder directly in `Visual Studio Code`
- Now open your `Terminal of your Visual Studio Code`.

- Now inside `Terminal`, type `npm init` and then press Enter.
- THen you will see something like in the following image. After that, press Enter again and then after that you can type `clear` in `Terminal` to remove all logs from the `Terminal`.
